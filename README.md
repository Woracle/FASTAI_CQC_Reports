# FASTAI_CQC_Reports

This Repos contains a notebook used in with Google Colab to extract CQC inspection reports from CQC API, using fast AI to first develop a language model and then using that language model to train a binary classifier.

The code is intended to act as a demo of the capabilities and promise of FASTAI / Deeplearning to speed up development of NLP models.
