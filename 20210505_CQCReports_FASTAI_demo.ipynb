        "\n",
        "It is often much better to take a langauge model that already understands the basic concepts of the language you are working in (i.e. English) and then tweak it to understand the specific domain you are working on. That way you don't have to teach it English, you only have to teach the model the subject matter / domain. This use of a general model and tweaking it to your domain is called Transfer Learning and it can really speed up the process of developing language models.\n",

        "The next word in sequence as opposed to requiring us to provide a specific classification to the model. (just a conveient wrapper internally it is still a classification task i.e. given this squence what is the next word)\n",
